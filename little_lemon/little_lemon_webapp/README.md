This project is the final project for the Meta Front-end Developer course on Coursera, offered by Meta. The project aims at creating a website using foundational skills from HTML5, CSS3, React, GitHub, and Git Bash. 
<br/>
In this course, we were encouraged to use relevant meta tags for SEO, as well as OGP meta tags for shareable content. 
<br/>
The website was constructed using React.js. Each component was built using best practices.
<br/>
It was also adamant to use Flexbox or Grid to style our components. 
<br/>
Lastly, the whole project creation, and updates, were done via Git Bash to Github.


##Please note##
In my case, I rerouted the pages using Next.js rather than Routes. Considering this, I also used Image from "image/next" to render images rather than the <img/> tag.
